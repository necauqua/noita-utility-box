This is a memory reading tool that reads some useful data
directly from a running instance of [Noita](https://noitagame.com).
Anything that's considered true cheating is hidden by default and requires you
to enable it with checkboxes, collapsing panels and/or settings.

This is useful if you want **no** mods to be installed yet want to do some
advanced stuff.

Download from GitHub Releases [here](https://github.com/necauqua/noita-utility-box/releases).

### Tools
#### Orb Radar
It has an orb radar tool which completely automatically finds 34th orb GTG
locations for the running game and tracks player coords in realtime.

> [!NOTE]
> Click the image below to see a video of it in action, GitHub doesn't allow
> embedding mp4s and a gif of good enough quality would be too big.

#### Live Stats
Automatically gets current death/win/streak/best-streak counts, formats them
and sets an OBS text input (through obs-websocket which you can enable in OBS
menus)

#### Player Info
Shows several pieces of information about the player.
- Currently held wands - this is mostly useful for the `Wand Simulator` button
  that will automatically open the wand simulator for the given wand and its spells.
- Shows exact material IDs and amounts in player inventory flasks and puches.
- Exact floating point values for player HP and max HP, useful for knowing
  sub-integer and otherwise irregular HP values.
- Current player damage multipliers, similar to orb radar to avoid having to
  shut down the game and read `player.xml` if you want to know them.

#### Streamer Wands
Reads all the information that [onlywands.com](https://onlywands.com) needs to
show your wands and sends it there, so you dont have to install any mods.

To use it, log in on [onlywands.com](https://onlywands.com), download their mod
(you dont have to upload the stats) and select that zip file in the
`Streamer Wands` tool with the `browse` button - this will read your
authorization token and the websocket host address from the zip file.

The mod is not installed/sideloaded in any way! It only reads your token and
host from the file for your convenience, you can type them in manually.

After that, if Noita is running and found you'll be able to click `connect` and
your wand data will be sent!

#### .. more coming
There are ideas floating for more tools useful for advanced Noita gameplay,
they will be added in future releases.

##### Orb Radar
There is much room for improvements, being functionality or readability:

- [x] Display current world orb rooms in NG & NG+
- [x] Filter orbs that are already taken
- [ ] Better accessibility features for the radar

##### Ingame overlay
For people like @Larandar that don't have a second screen, inject in one way
of another on top of fullscreen Noita some information:

- [ ] Orb radar
- [ ] Coords
- [ ] Arbitrary entity component information?

### Development

`cargo build/run` should just work to build or run the binary for your
platform, given that you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed.

If you're not on Windows, you can build the Windows .exe by doing:
  - `rustup add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` once and having `mingw-w64` installed on your system.
  - And then `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

If you're on NixOS (or just use Nix) the dev shell in `flake.nix` provides all
necessary dependencies for the above commands to work, you can enter is with
`nix develop` but I suggest using `direnv`.

To get a bit-by-bit reproducible builds of artifacts downloadable from
[releases](https://github.com/necauqua/noita-utility-box/releases), you can set
up [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/), and use
```bash
nix build .#linux
# or
nix build .#deb
# or
nix build .#windows
# or all at once
nix build .#linux .#deb .#windows
```

On NixOS the flake app is installable with
```bash
nix profile install github:necauqua/noita-utility-box
```
to get a bleeding edge version (from latest `main` commit) or
```bash
nix profile install github:necauqua/noita-utility-box/release
```
for the latest release.

If have `just` installed, there's a convenient `just check` shortcut that will
check for formatting and clippy errors to save on waiting for CI to catch
those (it will probably not work well on Windows).

### Contribution
If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR here on github, or send
patches on [tangled](https://tangled.sh/@necauq.ua/noita-utility-box),
[radicle](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/iris.radicle.xyz/rad%3Az2n8gDK7BUhNrt2aV2wCanazHoSSN)
or even to my [e-mail](mailto:him@necauq.ua?subject=noita-utility-box).

- This repo follows a convention of small atomic commits (the smaller the
  better) that I will fast-forward into the `main` branch once you pass my
  reviews. This means your PGP signatures and commit authorship will be fully
  preserved in git history.

- Each commit that has user-facing changes must also have a changelog entry
  added to the corresponding section under "Unreleased" in the `CHANGELOG.md`
  file.

- Since the commit (before that I was a bit loose) introducing this contribution
  section, this repo strictly follows the
  [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  naming scheme, I *will* ask you to reword commits.
  Also I find this
  [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)
  to be easier to digest, take a look.

- Any review comment fixes **must** be amended into respective commits, the
  final patchset should be clear of any "addressing reviews" commits.
  You can read
  [this](https://gist.github.com/thoughtpolice/9c45287550a56b2047c6311fbadebed2)
  excellent writeup on the topic. Also I cannot recommend enough checking out
  [jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj#readme) which makes all of the above
  that much easier compared to git.
